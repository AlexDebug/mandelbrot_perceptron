# Mandelbrot Perceptrom
### What I did

In this project I generate the mandelbrot set, I use numpy for this and I render with matplotlib, For do that I have learned how to use complex numbers in 
python and in numpy, here a nice plot 😊:

After that I decide to train a multi layer perceptron (pretty simple), the most difficult was the process of doing the animation below before doing this I
din't knew how to do matplotlib animations and It was very time consiuming but finally there is a nice gif that I finally created 😏:
